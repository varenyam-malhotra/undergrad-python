# Undergrad Python Projects

## Iris Flower Classifier (Machine Learning)
Used machine learning-including k-means clustering (unsupervised learning) and classification using logistic regression and random forest (supervised learning) on the classic Iris dataset from scikit-learn. I classified iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) based on on speal and petal length and width. My code for this program include dataset visualization with pairplots and cluster plots as well as grouping unlabeled flowers ans evaluating model accuracy and feature importance. 

## Predicting Heart Failure and Mortality Rates using Logistic Regression and Machine Learning
Used machine learning-logistic regression-to predict heart failure and specifically mortality rate using the death_event feature and clinical data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Began with data exploration and cleaning and visualizing data using pairplots and feature-correlation heatmaps, for correlation coefficient graphs. I standardized data and used the stratify option via the scikit-learn to create a train-test split to build and train the machine learning model. I evaluated the model to have a logistic regression test accuracy score of 0.727 and then refined hyperparameters, retrained the model, and then finally created a logistic regression coefficients graph to determine the effect of each feature on the probability of a heart failure/mortality death_event. 

## Flight Data Analysis
Used prominent machine learning and statistical analysis libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze flight data from LAX in 2004. Created advanced graphs and visualizations of the flight data and trends. A csv can also be found in the folder.

## Gaussian Smoothing Image Filtering
This folder creates of several files that contain code I wrote to perform image filtering and Gaussian smoothing to process images and make them much clearer to be analyzed. Used several linear algebra and matrix calculation methods as well as several Gaussian functions to create the smoothed images from the original, preprocessed images. I transposed, padded images, computed spatial weights, and applied Gaussian and Bilateral filtering techniques as well as several additional deep matrix operations to ensure the image is properly smoothed and processed for greater, improved medical analyses. 

## Polygon Game
Created a complex polygon game where the user has to avoid several incoming, moving shapes by using the arrow keys to evade the shapes and position the polygon accordingly. The longer the user lasts, the higher the user's score will be. Used knowledge of classes, object-oriented programming, inheritance, loops, and mathematical coding. I coded the convexpolygon and vec2D files whereas the game file is used to actually run and implement the code.

## Make Change
Python program to create change in the least amount of coins based on a user-entered money amount. Uses only quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

## Python Function Derivatives
Deals with computing error between the numerically determined and analytically determined approximation of the hyperbolic sine function for any user-entered value. 

## MonteCarlo Methods Pi Approximation
Used elements of MonteCarlo methods to approximate Pi.

## Library
Created a program to simulate a library and some of its many functions. There is a Book class that enables users to check in and check out books based on isbn numbers, titles, and authors. Furthermore there is also a Member class to create lists of checked out books and also add or remove books by checking out or returning books based on member IDs and names. 

## Gaussian Probability
Uses the Gaussian probability function and its involved mathematical operations. 

## Exception Handling
Raised several errors and performed several mathematical calculations while demonstrating familiarity with exception handling.

## Project A
Draws a bluejay at several random locations using several complex mathematical methods to draw the different shapes that a bluejay comprises of. Used the math and random modules to draw circles and triangles and position them at different places as well as draw beaks, heads, tails, and specifiy colors such as black, blue, yellow, and green. 

## Triangle Perimeter and Area Python
Determines perimeter and area for a triangle with any side lengths (user-entered values).

## isPrime
Program to determine if a user-entered number is prime or not.

## Shapes
Used classes and inheritance to define several different shapes and their attributes. Defined an overarching polygon shape class and then subclasses such as right triangles, rectangles, and circles.
