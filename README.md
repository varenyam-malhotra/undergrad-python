## Flight Data Analysis
Used prominent machine learning and statistical analysis libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze flight data from LAX in 2004. Created advanced graphs and visualizations of the flight data and trends. A csv can also be found in the folder.

## Polygon Game
Created a complex polygon game where the user has to avoid several incoming, moving shapes by using the arrow keys to evade the shapes and position the polygon accordingly. The longer the user lasts, the higher the user's score will be. Used knowledge of classes, object-oriented programming, inheritance, loops, and mathematical coding. I coded the convex polygon and vec2D files whereas the game file is used to actually run and implement the code.
