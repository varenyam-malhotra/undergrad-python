# Undergrad Python Projects

## Flight Data Analysis
Used prominent machine learning and statistical analysis libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze flight data from LAX in 2004. Created advanced graphs and visualizations of the flight data and trends. A csv can also be found in the folder.

## Gaussian Smoothing Image Filtering
This folder creates of several files that contain code I wrote to perform image filtering and Gaussian smoothing to process images and make them much clearer to be analyzed. Used several linear algebra and matrix calculation methods as well as several Gaussian functions to create the smoothed images from the original, preprocessed images. I transposed, padded images, computed spatial weights, and applied Gaussian and Bilateral filtering techniques as well as several additional matrix operations to ensure the image is properly smoothed and processed. 

## Polygon Game
Created a complex polygon game where the user has to avoid several incoming, moving shapes by using the arrow keys to evade the shapes and position the polygon accordingly. The longer the user lasts, the higher the user's score will be. Used knowledge of classes, object-oriented programming, inheritance, loops, and mathematical coding. I coded the convexpolygon and vec2D files whereas the game file is used to actually run and implement the code.

## Make Change
Python program to create change in the least amount of coins based on a user-entered money amount. Uses only quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

## Python Function Derivatives
Deals with computing error between the numerically determined and analytically determined approximation of the hyperbolic sine function for any user-entered value. 

## MonteCarlo Methods Pi Approximation
Used elements of MonteCarlo methods to approximate Pi.

## Library
Created a program to simulate a library and some of its many functions. There is a Book class that enables users to check in and check out books based on isbn numbers, titles, and authors. Furthermore there is also a Member class to create lists of checked out books and also add or remove books by checking out or returning books based on member IDs and names. 

## Gaussian Probability
Uses the Gaussian probability function and its involved mathematical operations. 

## Exception Handling
Raised several errors and performed several mathematical calculations while demonstrating familiarity with exception handling.

## Project A
Draws a bluejay at several random locations using several complex mathematical methods to draw the different shapes that a bluejay comprises of. Used the math and random modules to draw circles and triangles and position them at different places as well as draw beaks, heads, tails, and specifiy colors such as black, blue, yellow, and green. 

## Triangle Perimeter and Area Python
Determines perimeter and area for a triangle with any side lengths (user-entered values).

## Project B
Deals with analyzing and helping to conclude several aspects of material science, specifically bonding and bonding sites for several molecules. 

## isPrime
Program to determine if a user-entered number is prime or not.

## Shapes
Used classes and inheritance to define several different shapes and their attributes. Defined an overarching polygon shape class and then subclasses such as right triangles, rectangles, and circles.
