## Flight Data Analysis
Used prominent machine learning and statistical analysis libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to analyze flight data from LAX in 2004. Created advanced graphs and visualizations of the flight data and trends. A csv can also be found in the folder.

## Polygon Game
Created a complex polygon game where the user has to avoid several incoming, moving shapes by using the arrow keys to evade the shapes and position the polygon accordingly. The longer the user lasts, the higher the user's score will be. Used knowledge of classes, object-oriented programming, inheritance, loops, and mathematical coding. I coded the convex polygon and vec2D files whereas the game file is used to actually run and implement the code.

## Make Change
Python program to create change in the least amount of coins based on a user-entered money amount. Uses only quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.

## Python Function Derivatives
Deals with computing error between the numerically determined and analytically determined approximation of the hyperbolic sine function for any user-entered value. 

## MonteCarlo Methods Pi Approximation
Used elements of MonteCarlo methods to approximate Pi.

## Exception Handling
Raised several errors and performed several mathematical calculations while demonstrating familiarity with exception handling.

## Triangle Perimeter Area Python
Determines perimeter and area for a triangle with any side lengths (user-entered values).

## Project B
Deals with analyzing and helping to conclude several aspects of material science, specifically bonding and bonding sites for several molecules.
